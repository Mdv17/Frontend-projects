# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



## Summary for Navbar.jsx
This code defines a functional component called `Navbar` that renders a navigation bar. It uses the `useState` hook from the React library to manage the state of whether the navigation menu is showing or not. The component displays a logo, a list of navigation links, and a toggle button to show or hide the navigation menu.

## Example Usage
```javascript
import Navbar from './Navbar';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar />
      {/* Other content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- None
___
### Flow
1. The `Navbar` component is defined as a functional component.
2. The `useState` hook is used to create a state variable `isNavShowing` and a function `setNavShowing` to update its value. The initial value of `isNavShowing` is `false`.
3. The component renders a `nav` element with a container `div` inside.
4. Inside the container, there is a `Link` component that wraps an `img` element displaying a logo.
5. Next, there is an unordered list (`ul`) with class `nav__links`. The class is conditionally set to either `show__nav` or `hide__nav` based on the value of `isNavShowing`.
6. Inside the `ul`, a `map` function is used to iterate over the `links` array and render a list item (`li`) for each link. Each list item contains a `NavLink` component with the link's name and path.
7. Finally, there is a button with class `nav__toggle-btn` that toggles the value of `isNavShowing` when clicked. The button displays a `VscThreeBars` icon when `isNavShowing` is `false`.
___
### Outputs
- The `Navbar` component renders a navigation bar with a logo, a list of navigation links, and a toggle button to show or hide the navigation menu.
